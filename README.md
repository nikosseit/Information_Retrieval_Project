This project was implemented during the fifth year of my undergraduate program and focuses on Information Retrieval. It involved building an inverted index to store information essential for retrieval models, specifically the Vector Space Model and ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT). Developed and executed on Google Colab, this project utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, and others to manage and process large text datasets efficiently.

To evaluate the retrieval performance, I selected key metrics including Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), implementing both to gauge the accuracy and relevance of search results. Additionally, precision and recall plots were created to visualize model performance across various retrieval scenarios. This project demonstrates proficiency in core information retrieval techniques, as well as in the use of Python for advanced data analysis and visualization.
